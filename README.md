# My Utilities

This is a repository for my utilities that analyse Closed End Funds.
The basic main script is z_scores.py, which scrapes cefconnect.com for daily stats on any CEF. It returns a dataframe.

The script you should use to filter the dataframe is z_scores_dataframe.py. It saves the dataframe as a CSV file, filters it into "buy" and "sell" dataframes, and emails it to a list that you specify.

Use these informational tools to help you invest but you must do your own research before making an investment decision. The default settings represent my opinions and should not be taken as a recommendation or advice. Consult a financial advisor before making any investment, to best fit your situation and risk profile.
